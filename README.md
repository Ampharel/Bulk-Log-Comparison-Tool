This project allows users to analyze multiple arcdps logs for gw2 in bulk. This quickly shows patterns and makes it easier to spot mistakes / consistent issues.
It also allows you to quickly compare your logs and see if you're improving.

Current features:
* DPS data per phase, per player and per group
* Boon uptimes per phase, and boon duration on time stamps, per player and per subgroup
* Mechanic analysis per phase
* Automatic loading of new logs posted to chosen folder
* Multi-threaded loading of logs, loads logs in seconds
* Mass-Invisiblity - Stealth analysis


Specifically for HTCM:
* Shockwave stability analysis

This program in it's current form is not meant to be a replacement for the existing tools like dps.report, but rather quickly allow you to determine which logs are worth analysing using said tools.
