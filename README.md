This project allows users to analyze multiple arcdps logs for gw2 in bulk. This quickly shows patterns and makes it easier to spot mistakes / consistent issues.
It also allows you to quickly compare your logs and see if you're improving.

Current features:
* DPS analysis per phase
* Boon uptimes per phase
* Mechanic analysis per phase

Specifically for HTCM:
* Stealth analysis
* Shockwave stability analysis

This program in it's current form is not meant to be a replacement for the existing tools like dps.report, but rather quickly allow you to determine which logs are worth analysing using said tools.
